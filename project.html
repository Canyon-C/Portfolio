            <p class='description'>As one of my first front-end development projects, I wanted to develop
                something that fully encapsulated my previous and ongoing learnings. Using front-end
                web-development
                tools in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, one of the sole goals was to learn
                and continue developing my
                skills. Through this venture, not only have I accomplished my goals, but most importantly, I
                now have an outlet where I can express myself through my interest in computer science.</p>
